Beta website to SWOT Racing platform. HTML + CSS initially. JS being added gradually.  Please, refer to me if you want to make a change. Everything is welcome, but it's extremely important to follow the pattern of the brand (colors, etc)  It's a platform composed by:  A landing page as a home page, where there will be carousel, a menu, some important info on the top, the logo, and social media links on the bottom; A button that leads to a 'user area' of the website, where every user will find: personal information, profile picture, available championships, etc (in the future, it's going to be possible to find a ranking system, and a fully automatic control of the events.
